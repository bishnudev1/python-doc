While Loops in Python
- The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
- We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate beforehand.

Syntax of while Loop in Python

- while test_expression:
     Body of while

For Loops in Python
- The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
- We can generate a sequence of numbers using range() function. range(10) will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers).

Syntax of for Loop

- for val in sequence:
    loop body
