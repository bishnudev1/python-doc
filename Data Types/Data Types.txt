Data Types in Python
- There is two types of datatypes in Python

-- Mutable [ Can change it's state or contents ]
---List, Dictionary, Byte array

-- Immutable [ Can't change it's state or contents ]
---Int,Float,Complex,String,Tuple,Set

1. Number
   - Integars [ 2,3,4,5,29 ]
   - Floating Point [2.5,3.4,9.1 ]
   - Complex Number [ 1+2i, 9+3j ]

2. String
   - 'Hello'
   - "This is awesome@123"
   - 'This is also a string'
   - '''
	My name is
		Bishnudev
			Khutia
     '''
3. List
- List is an ordered sequence of items and it's the most used datatypes of python.
- example of List is l = [2,3.5,"Bishnudev"]

4. Tuple
- Tuple is faster List but you can't modify items in it
- example of Tuple is t = (2,4.5,'Hello')

5. Dictionary
- It contains Key and Value in it
- It mutable data type, you can modify items in it
- It mostly use in Database works
- example of Dictionary is dic = {
    'name':"Bishnudev",
    'age':20,
    'isSmoking':False
}

6. Set
- You can't repeat same items in it
- It's a immutable datatype just like Tuple
- example of Set is s = {2,3,"Hi",True}
