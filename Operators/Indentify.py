# Identify Operators in Python

# 1. is -> Returns True if both variables are the same object
# 2. is not -> Returns True if both variables are not the same object
# The difference between Comparision and Identify Operators is that Identify Operator check the datatypes of two variables where Comparision Operator checks the Value of the variables

a = 10
b = 10.5
c = 'Hello,World!'

print(a is b)
print(a is not b)
print(c is not a)
